# Information

This is a student companion learning dashboard built with react and supabase for user authentication.

The idea is so that student who I teach web development can access materials and videos for references and revision.

It contains links to youtube videos that explain each concept in details and also little exercises for practices.

It has two sections: 1. Courses and 2. Exercises
